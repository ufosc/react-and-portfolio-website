# Hello World
This is a trivial example of a website. It serves to get you familiar with the structure of a React project. It will serve a simple `Hello, World!` when the page is accessed. Checkout `src/index.js` and you'll see that the boilerplate code added by React is actually longer than the content that we're trying to serve!

## Try it out!

1. First, make sure all necessary packages are installed by calling `yarn install` in this directory.
2. Next, call `yarn start` to see the page in your browser!
3. If the page doesn't open automatically, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a new tab.
