# Props

As we can see in `ExampleComponent.js` it takes an argument. This argument can be called anything and it is a basic [JavaScript Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object). These named values can be passed from a parent compoenent down to a child componenet. You can see this in `App.js`.
