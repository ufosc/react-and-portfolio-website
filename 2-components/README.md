# Components - Coming Soon!

Now we'll get a little more into content to make use of the React library! Here we make some simple cards that can be reused later in this project or even in another project entirely. You'll notice that even here, much of the code to make the cards resides in the CSS of the card component. Most of the visual code you will write for web development will be in CSS.


You'll also notice that there are no HTML files in the `src` folder of this project. That's because React makes use of the JSX paradigm where HTML and Javascript are written together in order to better organize components. This can be a bit confusing if you're used to writing vanilla HTML and Javascript, as you'll sometimes encounter a component that switches between `{}` and `()` so much that you'll think you're writing LISP! However, use this small example to familiarize yourself with the patterns of JSX before moving to the next lesson.
